=head1 NAME

Tuvix::InstaPlugin - Extend Tuvix (and maybe Plerd in the future) with photoblog support

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Tuvix::InstaPlugin::Post;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is some sort of pluin for L<Tuvix|https://github.com/doddo/tuvix> which enables jpeg files as source files. It will apply some various filters and the like, crop, scale and make it into an Plerd::Post.

It does not currently work with Plerd because it does not have extension support yet,.
